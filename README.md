# Web Image Extractor

Web Image Extractor ultilizes different libraries to extract (or favorite) images off of websites, such as Twitter, Pixiv, or if the url contains the image itself it extracts that that.

Also has image lookup functionality by utilizing Selenium which will auto-open the chrome browser and autofill the url to lookup.

This is a personal project for learning so there are certain features that "only work on my machine".
