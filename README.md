# Web Image Extractor

Web Image Extractor is a basic tool used to extract images from websites and download them.

Currently this tool is useless to anyone besides myself as I have it integrated with my cloud
storage drive with specifically named directories and sub-directories for certain artist. That isn't
to say it cannot be changed to allow more utilization (i.e. allowing users to create a .json file to
pull from). But I don't see this tool getting use from anyone outside of myself and my specific use
case as I tend to download images from Twitter rather than "like" them as I would rather have a way
to manage images based on certain criteria (i.e. what show/game they come from, who the artist is as
well as automatically assigning the name of the artist and the source it came from).
